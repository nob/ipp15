Holy @#*$?!!!!

Christian’s sensei is coming to Berkeley.

Please welcome Taneda-san (from Nagomi) to the East Bay for two nights in January.
Try the latest in Tokyo nibbles and meet the man who inspired Ippuku.
He can’t take credit for everything we’ve done (but he probably should!).
Please RSVP ASAP as seating is limited. (January 13-14)
